![demo_1104](description/demo_1104.gif)

### Guideline

The Information App for the prototype should cover Escorting Tamariki and Rangatahi. Escorting is the process of removing, relocating, and uplifting tamariki and rangatahi from their current place of care. The app should provide information to caregiver’s for the following sections: 

1.	**Information.** 
   1.	What is Escorting? 
   2.	Types of Escorts? 

2.	The **Process of Escorting**. The following is a guideline for when escorting has been actioned. 
   An assessment is made when the environment has been identified as a risk, meaning escorting is necessary. 
   1.	Oranga Tamariki becomes the custodians of children when escorting is in action. 
   2.	Oranga Tamariki are NOT custodians of children WHEN others have assumed responsibility. 
   3.	Escorting is authorized by someone in charge – also, provide information on the conditions. 
   4.	The Informed Escort Strategy and who it is provided to. 

3.	**Legal Rights of Parents.** 
   1.	Legal rights for parents shall refer to Escorting and/or the Escorting process, NOT legal rights in general. 

4.	**Legal Rights of Caregivers.** 
   1.	Legal rights for Caregivers shall refer to Escorting and/or the Escorting process, NOT legal rights in general. 


### What the app should provide? 

1.	**Target Audience:** Parents, Caregivers 
2.	For each section: 
   1.	Provide details and summarise information in the context of a mobile app. 
   2.	Provide links for users for further information. 
3.	You can obtain most of the information from: 
   1.	[Oranga Tamariki](https://practice.orangatamariki.govt.nz/policy/escorting-tamariki-and-rangatahi/) 
      1.	This site has a lot of unnecessary information therefore, you are advised to look for information under the sections provided. 

   2.	[Community Law organization for NZ](https://communitylaw.org.nz/community-law-manual/chapter-13-dealing-with-oranga-tamariki-ministry-for-children/dealing-with-oranga-tamariki-ministry-for-children/) 
      1.	This site provides a lot of legal processes and advice; therefore you are advised to look for information under the sections provided that focus on escorting, but include information that could help and assist.

</big></p>

<p>Escorting is an official process in which a child is taken away from an environment that is dangerous. This process
    is enacted by Oranga Tamariki, or the Ministry for Children, as it is better known—the government agency for issues
    surrounding the welfare of children.</p>

<p><big>
    <font color="#007bb5"><b>Types of Escorting</b></font>
</big></p>

<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Planned Escorts:</b></font> Planned removals are those that are pre-arranged, where Oranga
    Tamariki work with the families and other agencies about the strategy for a child\'s relocation. The process involves
    thorough assessments and planning that need to be carried out to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.
</p>
<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Urgent Uplifting:</b></font> Urgent removals are those in which the child is at imminent
    risk, and something needs to be done straight away to ensure their safety. It may be that a child is considered at
    immediate risk of harm, and Oranga Tamariki may not have to notify the family but go straight into taking action to
    keep the child safe.
</p>

<p><big>
    <font color="#007bb5"><b>Who takes custody of the child after removal?</b></font>
</big></p>

<p>
    The child that is taken away from
    home falls into the custody of Oranga Tamariki Ministry for Children. This child will be sent to stay with a family
    member or somebody that he or she knows well. In case this may not be practicable or appropriate, the child could be
    placed into a ministry home or residence.
</p>
<p>
    Unless there is a good reason against it, you should be told as soon as possible about what is happening and why, and
    about what is likely to happen in the future. You may also telephone the Ministry at any time of day or night for
    information.
</p>
<p>
    When a child is taken away from home and put into care by Oranga Tamariki Ministry for Children, it must be brought
    before a Family Court within five days. You will be advised of the court decision.

    <font color="#007bb5"><b>Process of Escorting</b></font>
</big></p>

<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Risk Assessment:</b></font>
</p>

<p>
    A very careful risk assessment is carried out to review the
    environment and decide whether there is a requirement for escorting the child for safety purposes.
</p>
<p> Oranga Tamariki loses custody when any other person or agency takes legal custody of the child.</p>


<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Authority to Escort and Escorting Conditions:</b></font>
</p>

<p>
    Escort is granted by a manager at
    Oranga Tamariki, and conditions include the fact that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> There should be a minimum of two escort staff who have had.</li>
    <li> An escort of the same gender as the child whenever possible.</li>
    <li> The staff have to be well trained to handle de-escalation.</li>
</ul>

<p><big>
    <font color="#007bb5"><b>Risk assessment and planning of the journey</b></font>
</big></p>

<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Informed Escort Strategy:</b></font>
</p>

<p>
    This is a strategy that involves a lot of planning and
    communication, with information provided to all parties, including the child, the family, and caregivers, so that
    all are aware of the reason for and the procedure for the escort.
</p>
<p> Refer to Oranga Tamariki\'s escorting policy for further information on these processes.</p>

    <font color="#007bb5"><b>Legal Rights of Caregivers and Parents</b></font>
</big></p>

<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Legal Parent Rights:</b></font>
</p>

<p>
    Parents have some legal rights in the process of escorting,
    such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Being informed in advance of plans for escorting their child;</li>
    <li> A chance to comment and express views about what occurs during the escorting process.</li>
    <li> Access to Information: Being informed of the reasons for escorting and where the child is being taken.</li>
</ul>

<p> For more details on these, refer to Community Law\'s guidebook to dealing with Oranga Tamariki.</p>

<p><big>
    <font color="#007bb5"><b>What are the rights of parents when it comes to this matter during eviction.</b></font>
</big></p>

<ul>
    <li> Right to Information: A parent can be informed of the decisions made about the child, including any plan for
        escorting. Oranga Tamariki shall inform a parent of the grounds of escort, destination, and such other relevant
        information.</li>
    <li> Participation in Decision-Making: Parents are entitled to take part in decision-making on matters relating to
        their child\'s care and protection. This includes the opportunity to take part in Family Group Conferences and
        other meetings which may be held in order to formulate a plan, which may then involve escorting.</li>
    <li> Access to Advocacy: Parents should have access to independent advocacy that might assist them in dealing with
        Oranga Tamariki. An advocate may assist parents in negotiating their rights and processes so their voice is
        firmly heard.</li>
    <li> Right to Legal Representation: If legal proceedings are initiated, such as the application for a Care or
        Protection Order, parents have rights to legal representation. Agencies like Community Law provide free legal
        advice and representation if the criteria for eligibility are met.</li>
    <li> Right to Complain: Parents have a right to comment on the process of escorting or any actions taken by Oranga
        Tamariki. Oranga Tamariki takes avenues of responding to feedback and complaints addressing such concerns.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Consideration of Cultural Connections:</b></font>
</p>

<p>
    Oranga Tamariki shall, in respect of
    considerations for Māori families, take into account the whanau, hapū, and iwi of the child when it engages in
    decision-making processes. In this respect, this shall guarantee that all cultural identity and relationship matters
    are preserved as the child is escorted.
</p>
<p>
    Parents should be made to feel welcome to play an active role in being constructive, asking questions and seeking
    resources on behalf of their children.

    <font color="#007bb5"><b>For Custodians</b></font>
</big></p>

<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>What is the eligibility criteria?</b></font>
</p>

<p>
    To be appointed as a custodian for a child in
    New Zealand, non-parents must apply to the Family Court, providing detailed information about their relationship
    with the child and their suitability for guardianship. If the child\'s current guardians consent to the appointment,
    the process may be more straightforward. In the absence of such consent, the court evaluates the application based
    on the child\'s best interests, considering factors such as the applicant\'s relationship to the child, the child\'s
    safety and well-being, the preservation of the child\'s cultural heritage, and the child\'s own preferences if they
    are mature enough to express them.
</p>
<p>It\'s advisable to seek legal counsel during this process; organisations like Community Law offer free legal advice
    and assistance.</p>

<p><big>
    <font color="#007bb5"><b>Criteria for Appointment as Custodian</b></font>
</big></p>

<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Application to the Family Court:</b></font> Non-parents must make an application to the
    Family Court for being appointed as a custodian.
</p>
<p> The application ought to involve filing appropriate forms and details about your relationship with the child, how
    befitting you are to become the guardian of the child.</p>
<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Consent:</b></font> If the child\'s parents are the current guardians and they are in
    approval of your appointment, then it may be easier. Where parental consent is absent, the court will determine
    based on the best interest of the child.
</p>
<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Factors Court Consider:</b></font>
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Best Interest: Here, the court looks at the security and safety of the child.</li>
    <li> Relationship to Existing Parents/Guardians: The court examines your relation to the child, whether a parent,
        sibling, or family friend, to whom the care of a child was initially provided.</li>
    <li> Cultural Heritage: The court wants to preserve the child\'s cultural heritage.</li>
    <li> Child\'s Preference: The court may consider the child\'s view on this matter if he/she is old and mature enough to
        give his/her preference.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <font color="#cc6633"><b>Legal Advice:</b></font> It is advisable to seek legal advice in the case you want to
    pursue this route of custodianship.
